# Social-Media-webapp
 
## Full stack webapp developed using MERN.

### This is a webapp where user can upload pictures and date and location and any description.

- As the user submits his/her post the post data is sent to a mongodb database and tored there.
- Then a call is made to the database & it will render this data in a card format on the user home page.
- Also any other posts uploaded by the same user or other users will be visible on the home page.

I used MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, bootswatch and my favourite React.js to create this app. Hope you like it.
